**Details** <br>
Qubic Core Services (QCS) is thrilled to announce its plans for enhancing liquidity across multiple exchanges, with a focus on the United States and Southeast Asia. These listings will expand Qubic’s distribution to new geographies, unlocking access to a broader user base. Recent data indicates a growing interest from users based on the daily liquidity exceeding $50M USD, we are preparing the infrastructure to take Qubic to the next level. On one hand, we are making a significant move with an exchange available in all US states. On the other, we are initiating the first step towards listing on a Tier 1 futures exchange, paving the way for spot listings on Tier 1 exchanges by Q1 2025.
We're raising funds for several exchanges listings which are in the making and close to completion:

-One tier 1 futures listing <br>
-One tier 2 exchange in the United States <br> 
-One tier 2 exchange listing in Asia <br>

The estimated total cost for these listings, including fees, integration, MM and marketing, is around $339.700

And as a special reminder: these funds will exclusively be used for listing purposes.
